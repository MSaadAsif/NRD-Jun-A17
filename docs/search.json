    "text": "Reference Studies:\n\nZahid et al., 2022\n\nStudy Objective:\nTo identify patient- and hospital-level predictors of 30-day all-cause hospital readmission among adults hospitalized with sepsis and comorbid diabetes mellitus using a nationally representative dataset. This study also evaluates the clinical and economic burden of readmission in this high-risk population, including its associations with in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges.\nData Source:\nA retrospective cohort study using the 2016–2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), developed by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NRD enables tracking of individual patients across hospitalizations within a given year via synthetic identifiers, capturing discharges from U.S. community hospitals and supporting survey-weighted national estimates through complex sampling design.\nCohort Definition:\nIndex hospitalizations were included if they met all of the following criteria:\n\nAdults aged ≥18 years\nPrincipal diagnosis of sepsis, identified using ICD-10-CM codes for septicemia and systemic infection (isSepsis pattern, including A40, A41, R65.2*, etc.)\nEvidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus (Type 1, Type 2, or other), derived from secondary diagnosis fields using ICD-10-CM patterns E08–E13\nNon-elective admission\nIndex discharge by the end of November to allow for a complete 30-day follow-up period\nComplete data on LOS and NRD_DAYSTOEVENT, required to compute discharge dates\n\nOutcomes of Interest:\n\nPrimary Outcome:\n\nBinary indicator of 30-day readmission (Yes/No)\n\nSecondary Outcomes:\n\nIn-hospital mortality (binary)\nLength of stay (LOS, in days)\nTotal hospitalization charges (inflation-adjusted to 2017 USD)\n\n\nOutcome Definitions:\n\nReadmission:\n\nDefined using NRD’s linkage variables. Readmissions were identified only among patients with qualifying index events.\nTrauma-related hospitalizations were excluded only from the readmission pool to avoid planned or injury-related returns unrelated to sepsis care.\n\nMortality:\n\nIn-hospital death recorded during index or readmission (DIED = 1)\n\nLOS:\n\nReported in days; modeled as count outcome\n\nCharge:\n\nDerived from HCUP’s TOTCHG variable and adjusted to 2017 dollars using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data\n\n\nCovariates and Variable Construction:\n\nDemographic & Socioeconomic Factors:\n\nAge (categorized: 18–49, 50–64, 65–79, 80+)\nSex (FEMALE; ref = Male)\nPrimary expected payer (Insurance; Medicare, Medicaid, Private, Other)\nZIP-based median income quartile (ZIPINC_QRTL)\nWeekend admission (AWEEKEND)\n\nClinical Characteristics:\n\nDiabetes subtype (T1DM, T2DM, Other), derived from ICD-10 patterns\nComorbidities based on Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, using binary indicators:\nCongestive heart failure\nChronic pulmonary disease\nRenal failure\nLiver disease\nObesity\nHypertension\nCoagulopathy\nCancer (Lymphoma, Metastatic, Solid Tumor without metastasis)\nAcute complications identified via ICD-10 code matching:\nAcute Kidney Injury (AKI)\nAcute Respiratory Failure (ARF)\nMechanical ventilation\nVasopressor use\n\nHospital Characteristics:\n\nHospital bed size (Small, Medium, Large)\nUrban/rural teaching status (Metropolitan, teaching vs non-teaching, etc.)\n\nDisposition and Severity:\n\nNon-home discharge (e.g., SNF, hospice, other facilities, or death)\nLength of stay (categorized as above)\n\n\nStatistical Methods:\n\nSurvey Design and Weighting:\n\nAll analyses incorporated NRD’s complex sampling design using discharge weights (DISCWT), strata (NRD_STRATUM), and clustering (HOSP_NRD) via the survey and srvyr packages.\n\nDescriptive Statistics:\n\nWeighted baseline characteristics of index hospitalizations were summarized and stratified by 30-day readmission status to compare patients who were readmitted versus those who were not.\nStratification was performed using a derived binary variable, which categorized patients as:\n\nWith 30-day readmission\nWithout readmission\n\nP-values from design-based statistical tests (Rao–Scott adjusted chi-square for categorical variables; design-based Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables).\n\nMultivariable Regression:\n\nA survey-weighted logistic regression modeled predictors of 30-day readmission.\nThe model included demographic, clinical, hospital-level, and index-stay factors.\nReference levels were explicitly set (e.g., Male, T1DM, LOS ≤4 days).\nResults were exponentiated to yield odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\nSoftware:\nAll analyses were conducted in R Statistical Language (Version 4.5.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."
